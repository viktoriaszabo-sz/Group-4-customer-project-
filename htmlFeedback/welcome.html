        <p>Welcome to the LearnWell feedback session!<br>
        <br>
        The session is organised together with the 1st year students, study counsellors, and researchers from the LearnWell team. The aim is to discuss together study-related well-being both from the students and the teaching/degree programme perspectives.<br>
        <br>
        Factor scores are computed as a mean value of its five-point Likert scale items (1 = totally disagree, 3 = between, 5 = totally agree)<br>
        High value is the aim in self-efficacy, psychological flexibility and self-compassion. In other factors, the lower the value, the better the result.</p>
