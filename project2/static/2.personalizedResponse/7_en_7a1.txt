Feeling BURNOUT
45-30 – very burned-out 

You are burned-out – stress and exhaustion overwhelm you and might find yourself feeling cynical towards your education. You might also feel inadequate, which leads you to abandon your studies. Try to take a break from the assignments you have and reflect on your behaviour towards them. Whether or not you should leave tasks behind that’s not your responsibility, cutting some slacks on your expectations towards yourself. If necessary, talk to a professional about your issues.
