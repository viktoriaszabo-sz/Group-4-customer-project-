# Group 4 Customer Project HAMK EDU Group 4 

Main goal is to create an application that displays a personal answer based on user's feedback on the LearnWell form. 

The feedback would work accoridng to the following: 
- the Power BI database will have 2 columns, accoridng to "good" and "bad" questions (good - 5 is best, 1 is worst / bad - 5 is worst, 1 is worst)
- we get the sum of each column and create the categories based on that
- for example: if "good" sum is high and "bad" sum is low, it means that the student will belong the a higher category
                if "good" sum is low and "bad" sum is high, the student will belong to a lower category, advise to focus on their mental health, etc

  Goal is to have a functional website to display the pre-written scripts for the categories and have a working database connection for the backend
