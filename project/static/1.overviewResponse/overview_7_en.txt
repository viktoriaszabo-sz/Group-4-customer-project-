If one is feeling stressed and exhausted constantly, with lack of motivation and interest, there is a chance for burnout. It is normal to experience stress every now and then but if it gets to the point where everything feels overwhelming and one thinks they cannot cope with it any longer, there is a high chance that one might suffer from burnout. 

However, to know if one is suffering from burnout, it often needs a health-care professional to confirm it. In study-related burnout, exhaustion, cynicism and inadequacy might all be experienced at the same time and to a great extent. In this context, exhaustion means lack of emotional energy towards studying, as well as feeling tense and tired. Cynicism on the other hand means losing interest and motivation in oneâ€™s studies, while inadequacy is feeling ineffective with lack of accomplishment.
