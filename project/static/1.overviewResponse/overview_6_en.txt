The ability to recognize and accept emotions, as well as make conscious decisions rather than follow short-term impulses, is called psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility helps to act in emotionally tough situations and make decisions without letting emotions take complete control. 

In study context, psychological flexibility helps the student deal with situations that might cause negative thoughts such as anxiety or frustration. It helps them stay present in the moment, meaning they are able to be fully aware of their emotions and thoughts.
