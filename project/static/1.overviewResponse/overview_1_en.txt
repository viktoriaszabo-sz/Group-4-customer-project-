Here we divided learning approaches into three different categories: deep learning, organized studying, and surface learning. Typically, there are two general approaches to learning, which are deep and surface level learning. As the names suggest, in deep learning the student tries to get a deeper understanding of the subject and their motivation comes from their own desire to learn and understand more. 

Surface approach on the other hand, is the opposite of that. A student that is more oriented in this type of approach, focuses on a particular goal. This in many cases means a specific grade or the goal to please someone. This also means that the student is only keen to do the necessary instead of wanting to understand the meaning behind the material. 

As for the last category, organized studying, the student is somewhere in the middle. It is not necessarily an approach that has been identified by research, but it has the possibility to fit somewhere in the middle. When somebody studies in an organized way, they have the tendency to be more interested in the subject, or they at least have an interest in wanting to learn it. They might take notes, listen in class, and has the want to be more focused, but they might not be particularly deep approach takers â€“ or on the other hand, surface approach students.
