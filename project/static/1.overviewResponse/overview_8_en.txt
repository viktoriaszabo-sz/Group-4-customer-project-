Self-compassion means having a kind attitude towards oneself. It is being understanding towards ourselves when failures and mistakes happen, as well as having the ability to recognize them as a normal human experience and being mindful of it. 

In studying, self-compassion can help cope and recover from difficult situations, as well as fight against study-related stress. More self-compassionate students seem to be more resilient and have higher self-efficacy, making self-compassion a good predictor of well-being.
