Competence development is about learning skills and knowledge that the student can apply in the practical field. The acquired skills should feel useful to the student and should be able to be used effectively in a working environment. Gaining competencies through learning helps the student know their strengths and weaknesses better, as well as making them more confident in their ability to work practically. 

This also includes being able to work in a group as in nearly every working field one must interact with other people. The student needs to be able to collaborate, ask questions, verbalize their own thoughts, and see things from different points of view.
