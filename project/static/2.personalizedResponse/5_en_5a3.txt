You lack self-efficacy – you don’t necessarily trust your capabilities, which might cause you not putting enough effort in your studies and avoiding tasks or assignments. Recognize your previous achievements, so that you can be more persistent in your studies. Also, try reaching out to other students with similar situations, so you could feel more seen and heard about your problems.
