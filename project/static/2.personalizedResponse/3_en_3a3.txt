You do not feel competent in your studies, and you lack knowledge that would help you feel confident in your field. You feel like you do not have the required knowledge to be able to work effectively and you struggle to work in a group. Try to go over the basics of the subject you feel incompetent in and work your way up at your own pace. When you learn the basics and have acquired and understood it, it is easier for you to trust in your abilities and continue building up that knowledge. Do not be afraid to ask for help either. Asking help, especially from your fellow students, helps you gain those social skills that are needed in working as a group, as well as give you more of that needed knowledge.â€¯
