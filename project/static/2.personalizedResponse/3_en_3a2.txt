You feel somewhat competent when it comes to your studies, but you still have doubts about your skills. You could potentially work and know what you are doing, at least for the most part, but you might feel unsure if you are doing things correctly. Try and ask when it comes to it, maybe you are doing things right and it is about trusting yourself, or maybe you feel like you need more information. Either way, asking is a good way to start gaining that knowledge and confidence.â€¯
