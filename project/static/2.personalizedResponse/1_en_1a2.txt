Your studying is organized. You might not necessarily take a deep approach to learning, but you are more organized than someone who takes on a surface approach. You have the tools to shift to deeper understanding if you want to learn to understand and focus on the meaning, but you can also find yourself easily just repeating the learned information without deeper understanding.
