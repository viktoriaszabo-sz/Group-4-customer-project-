Your objectives for the future are not as clear as it should be. You might feel you can’t properly use the resources that are given to you or might not even feel like there’s anything to begin with. Try reaching out to your guidance counsellor or talk to peers in higher years to get some information regarding work placement, international opportunities or sustainability.
